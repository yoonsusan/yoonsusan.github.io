			Climate risk is defined as the "product of the likelihood of an event occurring and the magnitude of consequences should that event occur... [where] likelihood is defined as the probability of occurrence of a climate hazard." (New York City Panel on Climate Change, 2009)
			<br />
			<br />
			The New York Metropolitan region has been designated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as one of the top ten global cities in terms of population and in terms of assets exposed to coastal flooding due to storm surge. 

			<br />

			Additionally, the New York City public transit system is one of the country’s oldest infrastructure systems.  The New York City Transit subway system is the busiest subway system in the country, and the Long Island Railroad and Metro-North Railroad are the first and second largest commuter rail networks in the country.
			<br />
			The New York Metropolitan area is faced with specific climate change hazards: temperature increase, changes in precipitation patterns, sea-level rise, and increasingly frequent coastal storms.  
			<br />
			Sea-level Rise:<br />
			Forecasts predict sea-level rise to be between 12 to 23 inches by 2080’s.  With a rapid ice-melt scenario (based off current rates of ice melt in Greenland and Antarctica), sea-level rise could be between 41 to 55 inches.  This 12 to 55 inch stillwater elevation rise would exacerbate storm surge and coastal inundation.
			<br />
			Temperature:<br />
			Climate forecasts predict a steady increase in frequency of days above 90 degrees.  Estimates are between 38 to 70 days above 90 degrees per year by the end of the century.  Prior to 1990, there were approximately 17 days above 90 degrees per year.   This increase will cause significant damage to assets and strain on infrastructure.  
			<br />
			Extreme Precipitation:<br />
			Precipitation patterns show an increase in rainfall and non-coastal rainstorms due to global warming. Climate modeling predicts an annual precipitation increase between 5 and 15 percent by the end of the century.  Also, the number of days with over 2 inches of rain will increase a factor of 1.4 to 1.8.  
			<br />
			Coastal Storms:<br />
			By the 2050’s the IPCC has predicted that the frequency and intensity of intense hurricanes (category 3 or higher) is “more likely than not” to increase.  Without adaptation to combat sea-level rise and coastal storms, a 100 year flood event (“a flood that has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year”) will become 5 times more frequent by the 2050’s.

			Limit of Moderate Wave Action
			<br/>
			An additional area that may be shown on coastal FIRMs for informational purposes is the Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA).  The LiMWA identifies areas that will be affected by waves with a 1.5 foot wave height or greater within the coastal A zone.  While FEMA currently does not require special floodplain management standards or flood insurance purchase requirements based on LiMWA delineations, it is likely that properties and structures within the LiMWA will receive substantial damage from wave action during a one-percent-annual-chance flood event.  As a result, communities are encouraged to adopt the more stringent building construction standards applicable for V Zones in these areas.  View an animation that explains the LiMWA and the different coastal flood zones through FEMA's Media Library.
