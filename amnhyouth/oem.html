      <p><strong>Go Bags:</strong></p>
      <p>FEMA Flood Zone Maps are used by state and local government to determine areas that are at a high risk of flooding, drive preparation for those areas, and evacuation planning. They are also used by Community officials to create flood management regulations, and reduce flood damage. During hurricane Sandy, FEMA flood zone maps were almost 30 years out of date. Sea level rise over the past 30 years caused the storm surge from hurricane Sandy to be much higher than expected. People who weren't supposed to be affected got hit the hardest. As result, people in zone two did not evacuate and did not know where their evacuation centers were located. An area of over 20 square miles, with almost 300,000 residents was unexpectedly flooded.
	There are six evacuation zones, 1 - 6, and they are ranked by risk of flooding from storm surge impact. During hurricanes, people in these zones may have to evacuate. Dark red/dark orange indicate zone one, which has the highest chance of flooding.

      <p><strong>Go Bags:</strong></p>
      <p>Go bags are important to have, because in case of an evacuation, you must be able to  quickly have access to important documents, survival supplies, and any medications that you need.</p>
	    <p>The contents of a Go Bag should include:
      <ol>
        <li>Clean water</li>
        <li>Non-perishable food</li>
        <li>First-Aid kit</li>
        <li>Flash light</li>
        <li>Whistle</li>
        <li>Copies of important documents</li>
        <li>Money/Credit card</li>
        <li>Hygiene products</li>
      </ol>
