      <p>FEMA Flood Zone Maps are used by state and local government to determine areas that are at a high risk of flooding, drive preparation for those areas, and evacuation planning. They are also used by Community officials to create flood management regulations, and reduce flood damage. During hurricane Sandy, FEMA flood zone maps were almost 30 years out of date. Sea level rise over the past 30 years caused the storm surge from hurricane Sandy to be much higher than expected. People who weren't supposed to be affected got hit the hardest. As result, people in zone two did not evacuate and did not know where their evacuation centers were located. An area of over 20 square miles, with almost 300,000 residents was unexpectedly flooded.
	There are six evacuation zones, 1 - 6, and they are ranked by risk of flooding from storm surge impact. During hurricanes, people in these zones may have to evacuate. Dark red/dark orange indicate zone one, which has the highest chance of flooding.
	</p>
	<p>As a New Yorker, it is important to know which flood zone you live in; where you can go in case of an emergency, and how people in different zones are potentially affected by floods. FEMA flood zone maps inform people of the flood risks in different locations; if you are required to evacuate, and cannot find a friend or family member to shelter with, the City provides publicly available Evacuation Centers. As a coastal resident, our risk of flooding has increased due to sea level rise and increase in sea surface temperature.
Evacuation zones and centers:
During hurricane sandy the FEMA Flood Zone Maps did not cover the areas that were affected. This was due to FEMA not updating their maps in the last thirty years. People who weren't supposed to be affected got hit the hardest. In result, people in zone two did not evacuate and did not know where their evacuation centers were located.They were stranded in homes that didnâ€™t have electricity and heat. This map shows six evacuation zones so that you can locate which zone your home is in. The next layer on this map shows the various evacuation centers located around NYC.  The third layer of this map displays senior centers showing their proximity to the different evacuation zones and centers.  This information is important to anyone with aging family members to locate and assess their risk and options in the case of a flood. 

Health Facilities in hurricane Evacuation Zones:

Hospitals in areas with high flood risk may have to be evacuated during a hurricane because of flooding, and power loss. Most hospitals are equipped with backup generators, but if those fail, and the hospital loses power, it must be evacuated. In this map, you can see the six evacuation zones, and the locations of health facilities, such as hospitals, and hospices

      <p><strong>Go Bags:</strong></p>
      <p>Go bags are important to have, because in case of an evacuation, you must be able to  quickly have access to important documents, survival supplies, and any medications that you need.</p>
	    <p>The contents of a Go Bag should include:
      <ol>
        <li>Clean water</li>
        <li>Non-perishable food</li>
        <li>First-Aid kit</li>
        <li>Flash light</li>
        <li>Whistle</li>
        <li>Copies of important documents</li>
        <li>Money/Credit card</li>
        <li>Hygiene products</li>
      </ol>
