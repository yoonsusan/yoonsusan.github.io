<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
Home to 8 million people, New York City for countless years has been known as, “The city that never sleeps.”  With tall skyscrapers, busy streets, and a slew of residents, there is no denying the fact that within this dynamic city, there are many forces working to maintain order.  However on October 29, 2012 the once calm city was plagued with the misfortune brought by the immense hurricane, Sandy.  With powerful winds and substantial rainfall, Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc on New York City impacting thousands of people and crucial infrastructure. 
</p>	
<p><strong>Background Information:</strong></p>
<p>Hurricanes may seem complex, however the scientific principles that explain a powerful storm are simplistic.  Hurricanes are large masses of moving air, and some of the most dangerous meteorological phenomena on planet Earth.  Depending on where they form, Hurricanes are identified by numerous terms.  These names include typhoons and cyclones. More accurately Hurricanes are called tropical cyclones.  Tropical Cyclones form over the Equator, this is due to the fact that they are fueled by warm, moist air.  Warm air rises off the ocean creating a pocket of low pressure below, which new air rushes to fill.  As this process continues the air will condense into clouds.  These newly formed clouds spin as the Earth rotates on its axis. As winds become faster and faster, a low pressure area forms at the center of the storm.  This area is called the eye of the hurricane.  Through the eye, high pressure air enters the tropical storm.  As wind speeds exceed 74 miles per hour the tropical storm becomes a tropical cyclone. Hurricane Sandy could have been a run-of-the-mill hurricane, dispersing once it made landfall.  But, this storm was unlike anything New York City had seen since the 1938 New England Hurricane which destroyed cities all along the East Coast.  Arguably, there were three key factors that contributed to the force of Hurricane Sandy.  These three things include the storm’s, velocity, enormous size, and bad timing.  Its unique path across the Atlantic was unlike other storms that have reached New York City.  Rather than colliding with land near the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Sandy made landfall in in New Jersey.  According to Professor Mark Saunders, of the Department of Space and Climate Physics at University College London, stated that: “There is no precedent in hurricane records extending back to 1851 of a storm at this latitude taking this path.”  Meaning the storm would reach 800 miles inland after reaching the eastern coast.  To paint a picture, this would mean the storm would stretch to the Great Lakes.
This trajectory created some of the most violent floods and the strongest winds experienced by the east coast. In addition to this different path, the storm was extremely large.  Using sophisticated instrument called the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, NASA captured the, “Massive extent of [Sandy’s] clouds.”  The MODIS shows that during the time the eye of Sandy was in the Bahamas the western clouds were looming over the southeastern coast of the United States.  Finally, the timing of Hurricane Sandy contributed to its great force.  During the same week the hurricane made landfall, New York was experiencing a full moon.  Meaning, the typically shallow harbor was at high tide.  Before the storm experts predicted that the harbor could reach as high as eleven feet.  Unfortunately, they were on the right track.  Hurricane Sandy also began to “adapt” to the cold water and air surrounding the East Coast.  This caused the slow moving storm to alter its fuel source.  Therefore, Hurricane sandy could cause damage, flooding, and snowfall for two additional days.  
<p><strong>Hurricane Sandy’s Impact on New York City:</strong></p>
<p>Hurricane Irene, an earlier storm that impacted New York City, was part of the problem with the damage caused by Sandy.  In the days before Hurricane Irene, Mayor Bloomberg warned residents to be prepared for the worst possible outcome, as did President Barack Obama.  More significantly, Michael Bloomberg ordered the first mandatory evacuation in NYC’s history.  While the storm caused 1 billion dollars worth of damage, many New York residents were underwhelmed with the damage caused in the city, after all of the press the storm received.  This created a major conflict when, once again, the city urged residents in the at risk zones to evacuate.  Many people did not prepare.  This left the city and its thousands of stores, homes, and landmarks vulnerable to the storm surge and the violent winds.  Crucial modes of transportation, important power plants, and homes were all greatly impacted by the storm.  While these things may not seem relevant to the rest of the country, especially in places that were not affected by the storm, climate change is increasing the occurrence of such storms.  When catastrophic events were predicted to happen 1 year out of every one hundred, currently with the sea level rise and the increasing atmospheric temperature, the chance has been raised to an estimated 1 in 50 chance.  For many individuals, two cataclysmic storms every one hundred years is far too much to handle after seeing how long it has taken to rebuild after Hurricane Sandy.
