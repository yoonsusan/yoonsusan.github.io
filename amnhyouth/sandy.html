      <h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
      <p>
      Home to 8 million people, New York City for countless years has been known as, “The city that never sleeps.”  With tall skyscrapers, busy streets, and a slew of residents, there is no denying the fact that within this dynamic city, there are many forces working to maintain order.  However on October 29, 2012 the once calm city was plagued with the misfortune brought by the immense hurricane, Sandy.  With powerful winds and substantial rainfall, Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc on New York City impacting thousands of people and crucial infrastructure. 
      </p>	
      <p><strong>Background Information:</strong></p>
      <p>Hurricanes may seem complex, however the scientific principles that explain a powerful storm are simplistic.  Hurricanes are large masses of moving air, and some of the most dangerous meteorological phenomena on planet Earth.  Depending on where they form, Hurricanes are identified by numerous terms.  These names include typhoons and cyclones. More accurately Hurricanes are called tropical cyclones.  Tropical Cyclones form over the Equator, this is due to the fact that they are fueled by warm, moist air.  Warm air rises off the ocean creating a pocket of low pressure below, which new air rushes to fill.  As this process continues the air will condense into clouds.  These newly formed clouds spin as the Earth rotates on its axis. As winds become faster and faster, a low pressure area forms at the center of the storm.  This area is called the eye of the hurricane.  Through the eye, high pressure air enters the tropical storm.  As wind speeds exceed 74 miles per hour the tropical storm becomes a tropical cyclone. Hurricane Sandy could have been a run-of-the-mill hurricane, dispersing once it made landfall.  But, this storm was unlike anything New York City had seen since the 1938 New England Hurricane which destroyed cities all along the East Coast.  Arguably, there were three key factors that contributed to the force of Hurricane Sandy.  These three things include the storm’s, velocity, enormous size, and bad timing.  Its unique path across the Atlantic was unlike other storms that have reached New York City.  Rather than colliding with land near the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Sandy made landfall in in New Jersey.  According to Professor Mark Saunders, of the Department of Space and Climate Physics at University College London, stated that: “There is no precedent in hurricane records extending back to 1851 of a storm at this latitude taking this path.”  Meaning the storm would reach 800 miles inland after reaching the eastern coast.  To paint a picture, this would mean the storm would stretch to the Great Lakes.
      This trajectory created some of the most violent floods and the strongest winds experienced by the east coast. In addition to this different path, the storm was extremely large.  Using sophisticated instrument called the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, NASA captured the, “Massive extent of [Sandy’s] clouds.”  The MODIS shows that during the time the eye of Sandy was in the Bahamas the western clouds were looming over the southeastern coast of the United States.  Finally, the timing of Hurricane Sandy contributed to its great force.  During the same week the hurricane made landfall, New York was experiencing a full moon.  Meaning, the typically shallow harbor was at high tide.  Before the storm experts predicted that the harbor could reach as high as eleven feet.  Unfortunately, they were on the right track.  Hurricane Sandy also began to “adapt” to the cold water and air surrounding the East Coast.  This caused the slow moving storm to alter its fuel source.  Therefore, Hurricane sandy could cause damage, flooding, and snowfall for two additional days.  
      </p>
      <p><strong>Hurricane Sandy’s Impact on New York City:</strong></p>
      <p>Hurricane Irene, an earlier storm that impacted New York City, was part of the problem with the damage caused by Sandy.  In the days before Hurricane Irene, Mayor Bloomberg warned residents to be prepared for the worst possible outcome, as did President Barack Obama.  More significantly, Michael Bloomberg ordered the first mandatory evacuation in NYC’s history.  While the storm caused 1 billion dollars worth of damage, many New York residents were underwhelmed with the damage caused in the city, after all of the press the storm received.  This created a major conflict when, once again, the city urged residents in the at risk zones to evacuate.  Many people did not prepare.  This left the city and its thousands of stores, homes, and landmarks vulnerable to the storm surge and the violent winds.  Crucial modes of transportation, important power plants, and homes were all greatly impacted by the storm.  While these things may not seem relevant to the rest of the country, especially in places that were not affected by the storm, climate change is increasing the occurrence of such storms.  When catastrophic events were predicted to happen 1 year out of every one hundred, currently with the sea level rise and the increasing atmospheric temperature, the chance has been raised to an estimated 1 in 50 chance.  For many individuals, two cataclysmic storms every one hundred years is far too much to handle after seeing how long it has taken to rebuild after Hurricane Sandy.

      <p>	In the past, regions impacted by extreme weather have been islands.  For instance, the Federated States of Micronesia, small pacific islands, are being greatly harmed by the changing climate and irregular weather patterns.  In United Nations conferences, the president of these islands, Emanuel Mori, stated that the country’s existence depends on reform in the emissions of greenhouse gases. He also posed an interesting question, “How do I tell my people that their plight and their future lie in the hands of those most responsible for greenhouse gasses?”  
      While the situation in New York City may not be this dire, Much of New York City’s population reside on the low lying island of Manhattan.  For many of these individuals, the impacts of violent storms, such as Sandy, pose large threats.  According to a report conducted by the Natural Resources Defense Council, of the 302,00 housing units flooded in New York City, roughly 12% were units owned by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA).  NYCHA provides housing opportunities for low and moderate income residents of New York.  In their mission statement they describe their goal of allowing people to access safe and affordable housing.  However, after Hurricane Sandy it was clear that not all of these buildings were safe.  For instance, in the Rockaways, an area of New York City that faced some of the worst damage from the storm.  A housing unit called Carleton Manor rested right within the surge area. The basement of the building flooded badly causing power outages for the residents.  
      In a statement issued by NYCHA Chairman John B. Rhea, he stated that, “At NYCHA, we all know the struggles so many of you had to face, not knowing when your lights would come back on, or if you would have to go to sleep without heat for another night. To say you were inconvenienced would not do justice to what you experienced.”  After the storm, it is clear that NYCHA developments faced massive amounts of damage.  NRDC estimates that 121,560 NYCHA residents lived in the FEMA flood zone area or in the housing units that were unexpectedly flooded.  Plus, 28 NYCHA developments were unexpectedly flooded and 34 were “expectedly” flooded.  Additionally, 
      
      NYCHA developments already suffer from immense water damage and rampant mold.  Despite numerous calls to action, nothing has been done to fix the problem.  The high poverty rates and lack of attention paid to this demographic means that as the storms become increasingly more severe, nothing is being done to assist these individuals.  Finally, 89,953 individuals living in poverty were impacted by Hurricane Sandy.  With few accessible modes of transportation and very few safe temporary homes, thousands of people were stranded in the city until the storm had passed.  Even afterwards, there was no power due to the damaged power plants and electric systems.  
      Numerous things can be learned from the tragic events that transpired during and after Hurricane Sandy.  What is certain of those issues is that the demographic most at risk have the least power when it comes to democratic reform.  Overall, the government is placing countless New Yorkers at risk when it comes to protecting against future natural disasters.

      <p><strong>At Risk Power Plants and Electrical Systems: By Olivia Kupiec</strong></p>
      <p>Hurricane Sandy’s affect on New York City was an extremely difficult impact on our society. One of the biggest problems of this natural disaster that the city faced was the impact it had on the major power plants around the city, from hitting hard impacts on the east of manhattan to completely damaging power plants at the tips of staten island and the Rockaways. Now what did these damages do to New York City? Power outages, major ones. 
      The damage on the Consolidated Edison Power Plant in the East Village of Manhattan was one of the biggest disasters out of this whole hurricane affect on New York City. On November 29, 2012, at 9 p.m., an explosion at the power plant occurred, leaving 750,000 residents without power. The explosion happened on 14th street near the bank of the east river and plunged most of lower manhattan into darkness. Most buildings from 39th street and under lost all power, while buildings above 39th street still lit up the city. The vice president of Con Edison presumed that the outage would be fixed in 3-4 days but the power lines would take a couple weeks to fix. This left thousands of people without heat, water, in their own homes. Many evacuated and stayed in other forms of shelter, while many stayed put in their homes, enduring the cold and darkness for, in some cases, a few months.

<p>Other damages to power plants in Rockaway beach were also challenging. The Jamaica Bay Peaking and the Bayswater Peaking Facility are located at the edge of the borough, leaving them completely vulnerable and surrounded by water. Homes in Rockaway were without power for several days as their area was hit hard by flooding because of their 
 vulnerability by their location near the ocean. About 1,200 residents of Rockaway were without power for days, weeks, and for some even months. Other power plants damaged by this superstorm include Gowanus Gas Turbines, Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration, Hudson avenue Power Plant, Hell gate Power Plant, New York Power Authority (Pouch), and numerous other facilities. No specific Information was given by for these other power plants but were said to have been damaged as they are located in the flooded areas that were reported because of Hurricane Sandy. 
These Power Plants have a large importance to New York City’s survival and flourishment. When one of them is impacted, who knows the damages it would inflict on the surrounding communities. New York City has already seen the consequences of these impacts. Citizens know they can’t have any more damages done to their society because of these natural disasters. Striving to live in shelters and other homes because of the loss of power and heat in their original homes is not the way to live. People are already starting to take action by planning and designing power plants in spaces less susceptible to flooding and disaster. Relocating these facilities is one more step to helping the community regain their losses due to the dangerous superstorm Hurricane Sandy.

<p>During Sandy crucial transportation systems were damaged. Many subway stations in lower Manhattan were severely damaged and/or flooded.  This resulted in a great level of frustration for New Yorkers.  It also created a problem for certain trains and stations.  Numerous flooded areas were out of commission for many months after the storm. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, or MTA, was flooded in many parts of Manhattan.  
The MTA was flooded in many parts in Manhattan this image shows the tunnels that were flooded and how much water entered the tunnels. Sandy mostly affect the under river tunnels connecting Manhattan to Brooklyn shown in the royal blue, some stations on the island of Manhattan itself were affected as well shown in light blue.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Overall, the impact of Hurricane Sandy was undeniably significant.  With the immense damage exerted on the homes of New Yorkers, the harm caused to the power plants, and the flooding of the subway stations and tracks, it is clear that storms such as Sandy must be taken seriously.  For the future, experts have developed natural barriers for some low lying areas as well as designs for fortified subway stations.  However, one important lesson to learn from Hurricane Sandy is that no level of preparation can protect against storms of this caliber.  While numerous factors contributed to the force of Hurricane Sandy it is evident that natural disasters such as this are due to climate change and the growing intensity of weather patterns.  According to an NRDC report, communities must help reduce Carbon Dioxide emissions which are contributing to the sea level rise as well as the intensification of weather patterns.  If changes are not made regarding human activity, coastal communities will be be at risk for flooding caused by sea level rise.  Now more than ever has the demand for reform in the way climate change is handled been so great.  Local and national governments are seeking ways to solve the problem, but until then residents of cities like New York, should attempt to be prepared for what the future has in store.
